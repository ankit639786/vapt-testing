  description: "VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing) is an extensive assessment conducted by cybersecurity experts to identify the threats in an enterpriseâ€™s network system and measure the level of vulnerability. It is essential for companies that store sensitive data in the network ecosystem and have not checked the possible vulnerabilities inside. At such a crucial juncture, we provide our real-time VAPT testing assistance to identify unauthenticated access to your information and scan for cyberattacks to safeguard your network system.",
